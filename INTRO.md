# A-Robust-Facial-Expression-Recognition-System-for-Monitoring-Patient-during-Physiotherapy-practices.
This project aims to develop a robust facial expression recognition system capable of continuously monitoring a patient’s emotional state, engagement level, and discomfort during physiotherapy sessions. Physiotherapy often involves repetitive and sometimes painful exercises, where a patient’s adherence, motivation, and pain tolerance significantly influence recovery outcomes. Traditional monitoring methods rely heavily on subjective reporting by patients or manual observation by therapists, which can lead to inconsistencies and delayed responses.

To address this limitation, the proposed system utilizes computer vision and machine learning techniques to automatically interpret facial expressions in real-time. By leveraging OpenCV for facial landmark detection and deep learning-based classifiers (such as CNN, SVM, or hybrid models), the system identifies key facial cues — such as eyebrow movement, eye constriction, lip tension, and other micro-expressions — that correspond to levels of pain, stress, or engagement.

A carefully curated or pre-trained pain and emotion recognition dataset will be used to train the model, ensuring robustness across diverse facial structures and lighting conditions. The model will classify expressions into categories like neutral, engaged, mild discomfort, pain, and high distress. The system will then provide real-time feedback to therapists, helping them adjust therapy intensity, provide encouragement, or alter exercise strategies based on the patient’s non-verbal cues.

Additionally, the project may integrate a data-logging module that records session-wise emotion and discomfort trends, supporting long-term progress tracking and adaptive therapy planning.

Ultimately, this system aims to enhance patient safety, comfort, and therapeutic outcomes by introducing objective, AI-driven emotion analytics into physiotherapy sessions.
